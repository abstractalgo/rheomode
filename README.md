Rheomode is a proposed mode of language developed by theoretical physicist David Bohm. It is intended to create a language structure that is not prone to fragmentation, and to emphasize the importance of verbs rather than nouns.

It was developed as part of his book [Wholeness and the Implicate Order](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204523.Wholeness_and_the_Implicate_Order).
